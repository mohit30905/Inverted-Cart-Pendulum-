# Inverted Cart-Pendulum
This project demonstrates the simulation and control of an **Inverted Cart-Pendulum System** using **LQR (Linear Quadratic Regulator)** and **Pole Placement** techniques in MATLAB.

## üéØ Objective

The goal of this project is to stabilize a pendulum in the inverted position on a cart, using modern control techniques. The pendulum starts from a displaced or falling position and is brought to the upright position while keeping the cart stable on a track.

## üß† Techniques Used

- **Linear Quadratic Regulator (LQR)**: An optimal control method that minimizes a cost function based on state and control effort.
- **Pole Placement**: Manual placement of closed-loop poles to achieve desired dynamic behavior.

## üì∫ Learning Source

This project is based on concepts and code structure explained in this excellent YouTube playlist:

üìò [Inverted Pendulum Control Series ‚Äì by Steve Brunton](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLMrJAkhIeNNR20Mz-VpzgfQs5zrYi085m&si=Xf09VGBPqjSV6Xvo)

> I highly recommend watching the entire series for a deep understanding of the mathematics and intuition behind these control methods.
